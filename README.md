# Bayesian Net Markov Chain Monte Carlo

## Consultation

Grant Sparks and I collaboratively created the Conditional Probability Tables by discussion mathematical formulas, and then entering these formulas into a spreadsheet. From this sheet we calculated and entered the Conditional Probability values into the submitted tables and code. The values were checked against values submitted in the discussion threads for week 12 and 13; the values for P(A | B?,C?,D?) Kshitija Taywade's posted in week 12, the values for P(D | A?,C?,E?) were obtained from Kshitija Taywade's post in week 13.
